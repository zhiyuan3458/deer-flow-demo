# [!NOTE]
# Read the `docs/configuration_guide.md` carefully, and update the
# configurations to match your specific settings and requirements.
# - Replace `api_key` with your own credentials.
# - Replace `base_url` and `model` name if you want to use a custom model.
# - Set `verify_ssl` to `false` if your LLM server uses self-signed certificates
# - A restart is required every time you change the `conf.yaml` file.

BASIC_MODEL:
  base_url: https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
  model: "qwen3-vl-plus"
  api_key: sk-77e3437844fe4ee5833a718e8f9e2337
  # max_retries: 3 # Maximum number of retries for LLM calls
  # verify_ssl: false  # Uncomment this line to disable SSL certificate verification for self-signed certificates
  # token_limit: 200000 # Maximum input tokens for context compression (prevents token overflow errors)

# Local model configuration example:

# Ollama (Tested and supported for local development)
# BASIC_MODEL:
#   base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1"  # Ollama OpenAI compatible endpoint
#   model: "qwen3:14b"  # or "llama3.2", etc.
#   api_key: "ollama"  # Ollama doesn't need real API key
#   max_retries: 3
#   verify_ssl: false  # Local deployment usually doesn't need SSL verification

# To use Google Ai Studio as your basic platform:
# BASIC_MODEL:
#   platform: "google_aistudio"
#   model: "gemini-2.5-flash"  # or "gemini-1.5-pro", "gemini-2.5-flash-exp", etc.
#   api_key: your_gemini_api_key  # Get from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
#   max_retries: 3
 
# Reasoning model is optional.
# Uncomment the following settings if you want to use reasoning model
# for planning.

# REASONING_MODEL:
#   base_url: https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3
#   model: "doubao-1-5-thinking-pro-m-250428"
#   api_key: xxxx
#   max_retries: 3 # Maximum number of retries for LLM calls
#   token_limit: 150000 # Maximum input tokens for context compression


# OTHER SETTINGS:

# Tool-specific interrupts configuration (Issue #572)
# Allows interrupting execution before specific tools are called.
# Useful for reviewing sensitive operations like database queries or API calls.
# Note: This can be overridden per-request via the API.
# TOOL_INTERRUPTS:
#   # List of tool names to interrupt before execution
#   # Example: interrupt before database tools or sensitive API calls
#   interrupt_before: 
#     - "db_tool"           # Database operations
#     - "db_read_tool"      # Database reads
#     - "db_write_tool"     # Database writes
#     - "payment_api"       # Payment-related API calls
#     - "admin_api"         # Administrative API calls
#   # When interrupt is triggered, user will be prompted to approve/reject
#   # Approved keywords: "approved", "approve", "yes", "proceed", "continue", "ok", "okay", "accepted", "accept"

# Web search toggle (Issue #681)
# Set to false to disable web search and use only local RAG knowledge base.
# This is useful for environments without internet access.
# WARNING: If you disable web search, make sure to configure local RAG resources;
#          otherwise, the researcher will operate in pure LLM reasoning mode without external data.
# Note: This can be overridden per-request via the API parameter `enable_web_search`.
# ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH: true
